### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From pixels to performance, I bridge the gap: Front-end dev & QA in one.

I leverage knowledge of Selenium Java, SQL, Maven, Cucumber, and Jenkins to build robust and reliable software. Additionally, I can craft user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces through JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I am passionate about delivering high-quality software products, believing in a holistic approach that encompasses both efficient development and comprehensive testing.
